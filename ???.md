# CyberDefenders CTF Lab Write-Up: BRabbit

## 1.- Introduction

  - **Challenge Name:** BRabbit Lab
  - **Category:** Threat Intel
  - **Difficulty Level:** Medium
  - **Scenario:** You are an investigator assigned to assist Drumbo, a company that recently fell victim to a ransomware attack. The attack began when an employee received an email that appeared to be from the boss. It featured the companyâ€™s logo and a familiar email address.
